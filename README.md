# JavaScript Examples Repository

Welcome to the **JavaScript Examples** repository! This repository is designed for students in the **Web Programming Principles** course to learn and explore JavaScript ES6 concepts through practical examples.

## Description

This repository contains several JavaScript examples that demonstrate how to use ES6 features such as:

- Arrow Functions
- Promises
- Modules
- Destructuring
- And more!

Each example corresponds to different classes and is labeled as `example<number>.html`, allowing you to follow along with your lessons and enhance your understanding of modern JavaScript practices.

## How to Use

To run and open the examples, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mouraleonardo/javascript-examples.git

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

    ```bash
    cd javascript-examples

3. **Open an example file in your browser:**

Each example is located in a separate HTML file. Simply double-click the `example<number>.html` file you want to run, or open it directly through your browser.

**Example**: To view the example for lesson 1, open the file `example1.html`.

4. **Run JavaScript code in the browser console:**

You can open your browser's developer tools (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in most browsers) to view the console and check the JavaScript output of each example.
